# RL_Q-learning_SARSA
Implementations and validations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) models
- Q-learning
- Double Q-learning
- SARSA
- Expected SARSA

A [report](https://github.com/j-nordin/RL_Q-learning_SARSA/blob/main/Project-Report.pdf) of the project is also made.

The models are validated in two different environments using a [gymnasium structure](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), RiverSwim (included locally in the project) and [FrozenLake-v1](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/)
